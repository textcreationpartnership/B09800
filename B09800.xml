            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS Concerning the Two Large BOOKS of ENTRIES.</head>
            <p>WHereas the Two Books of Entries <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Lord <hi>Cooke</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>William Rastall</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Books of great Authority, Reputation, and Use in the Law, have by reason of the long intermission of re-printing the same (occasioned by the late Troubles, and the want of Undertakers to go through with the Charge of new Impressions) been for many years very scarce; But now are undertaken to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed.</p>
            <p>Which, to carry on, so that no delay be made in a Work so great, useful and profitable to the Students and Professors in the Laws of this REALM: And that all Persons well-wishers to this undertaking, may have a fair and ample satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and benefit from the Undertakers; And as a proper and casie expedient thereunto: It is proposed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That whosoever will be pleased to deposite 10 s. in the Hands of any one of the Persons herein after named, for his first payment towards <hi>Rastalls</hi> Entries, shall be entituled to one of them in Quires.</p>
            <p>And so likewise whosoever will be pleased to deposite 10 s. for his first payment towards the Lord <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Entries, shall likewise be entituled to one of them in Quires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rastall</hi>'s Entries in intended to be first put in hand, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to be first finished; and <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Entries next, and to be finished in convenient time after.</p>
            <p>The next payment is thirty shillings, to be paid the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rastall</hi>'s Entries; and in like manner 30 s. more at the Reception of <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Entries, which amounts to 40 s. a piece.</p>
            <p>The Subscribers may please to understand for their better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that the said Books will be worth 50 s. a piece, and will not be sold for less to any but the Subscribers, upon such their Subscriptions, the like being now sold at 4 l. 10 s. and sometimes 5 l.</p>
            <p>Whosoever, for himself or Friends, depositeth 3 l. and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth for six of <hi>Rastall</hi>'s Entries, shall be enti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uled to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Book, and at the Reception of seven, shall pay but his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond payment for six.</p>
            <p>And in like manner, whosoever shall deposite 3 l. and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe for six of <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Entries, shall receive a Seventh Book, as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rastall</hi>'s Entries will be finished in <hi>Easter</hi> Term, 1670. And <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Entries in convenient time after.</p>
            <p>The Letter and Paper shall be of the same with the Sheet already printed for a Pattern, and page for page with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Editions; The Errors shall carefully be Corrected.</p>
